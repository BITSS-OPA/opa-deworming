Executive Summary
</span><span></span></div>

This report is part of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on deworming interventions. An OPA is a policy analysis that emphasizes high levels of transparency and reproducibility. It contains one [open output](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/) that best represents the facts to inform policy makers, one report (this document) that clearly explains all the analysis, and [one repository](https://github.org/bitss/opa-deworming) that contains all the materials to reproduce the report and final output.

This report describes three approaches to compute the net present value of mass deworming interventions. The first two approaches are exact reproductions from previous research [@baird2016worms; @klps4], and the third approach is a combination of the previous two with some modification suggested by Evidence Action, a key policy partner in this area. This third approach uses the same benefits as the previous approaches and adjusts for different costs, prevalence rates and length of treatment across settings. We suggest that this final approach should be used as the best available policy estimate to compare costs and benefits of deworming in different settings.

Our main policy estimate predicts that a mass deworming intervention will have a net present value (comparison of stream of benefits and costs from today's perspective) of `r main_pe_so` for a setting with average prevalence and average unit costs (among the countries where Evidence Action has data for). Readers interested in learning about the predicted value for a specific setting are encourage to use the [interactive app](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/) components of this OPA.

# Open Policy Analysis {-}

This report is part of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) project on deworming interventions. A framework for making policy analyses transparent and reproducible [@hoces2020framework], OPA’s goal is to clearly show how an analysis was conducted and how to best represent key figures or results for policy makers to use as a factual basis for deliberation. In addition, OPA facilitates the re-use of analyses across similar settings, and sheds light on how evidence generated by research is used in specific policy analyses.

 This OPA project contains three components, following the OPA principles laid out in the aforementioned paper:

  1. One single output that best represents the factual information required by policy makers to inform their position regarding a policy of mass deworming. This output is presented in Figure  \@ref(fig:main-pe-print), and described in the [results section](#policy-estimate) of this report. The connection between each component of the analysis and the final output can be explored interactively in [this web app](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/).

  2. This detailed report that describes how to obtain the policy estimate and describes each component of the analysis.

  3. [A repository](https://github.org/bitss/opa-deworming) that contains all the materials needed to reproduce the analysis with minimal effort (report and interactive app).  

This report provides a complete description of the analysis behind the results presented to inform a policy discussion on deworming interventions. It describes how to reproduce the analysis in its entirety, and includes all the methodological choices involved. In order to document all the steps without overwhelming the reader, the report is displayed in a layered fashion. The first layer consists of a narrative description of the analysis. The second layer, that appear after clicking in the ![screenshot](show_details.png?display = inline-block) contains equations that show how each piece of the analysis was carried out. And the third and final layer displays the code used to operationalize each equation. All this information is contained in this document using dynamic documentation [@xie2015dynamic], so interested readers can access the source file of the report and reproduce the entire document in their own computing environments.


# Introduction  

Parasitic worm infections, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis, are endemic in many countries across the globe, disproportionately affecting the poor. These parasitic worms interfere with regular bodily processes by decreasing nutrient uptake and can thus lead to serious consequences on human health, education outcomes, and long-term economic well being. In particular, evidence indicates that these worms contribute to malnourishment, impairment of mental and physical development, lower school attendance, and decreased wages [@croke2014long; @miguel2004worms; @baird2016worms].

Evidence from previous mass deworming interventions has demonstrated to be a highly effective public health policy. Here we provide a policy analysis that compares benefits and costs of deworming across different settings, allowing for the translation of research findings into different policy-relevant scenarios.

The goals of this OPA are three. First, to increase the transparency and reproducibility behind existing policy analyses on the costs and benefits of mass deworming programs. Second, to update this policy analyses with input from stakeholders closely involved in policy making around deworming. And third, to illustrate how an open policy analysis framework can be implemented in practice.

The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of deworming is computed using three different approaches:     

  1. Reproducing the original CBA produced by @baird2016worms, which estimates the net present value of a Kenya school-based deworming program after a 10 year follow-up for four different policy estimates.     
  2. Reproducing an updated version of such analysis on the same intervention but with additional follow-up data [@klps4].
  3. Producing a new analysis that, building from the previous two approaches, focuses on one specific policy estimate, and allows for results to vary depending on key characteristics of current settings where deworming policies are being implemented. This new approach was developed in consultation with a key stakeholder in this area, the non-governmental organization (NGO) Evidence Action (EA)[^1].




# Methodology  

We first describe the common elements across all three approaches, and then describe each approach in detail.

## Common structure {-}

The starting point is a comparison of a stream of benefits and costs over the lifetime of the recipients of deworming. The final policy estimate is the discounted sum of all costs and benefits, known as the Net Present Value (NPV)[^12].

[^12]: Approaches 1 and 2 also present results in the format of internal rates of return (IRR). Following the principle of open output, we restrict the presentation of results to just one format. NPV was chosen over IRR in consultation with Evidence Action to clearly communicate the scale of the welfare effects. [CONFIRM WITH GRACE]  


<details><summary>Show all the details</summary>

\begin{equation}
NPV = B - C \\
\end{equation}

Where:  

- $NPV$: net present value of the deworming treatment   
- $B$: benefits of the deworming treatment  
- $C$: costs of the deworming treatment

Benefits are equal to the additional lifetime earnings that individuals are expected to generate due to deworming treatment. These additional earnings are computed as a discounted sum over their working lifetime.

B =   \sum_{t=0}^{50}\left(  \frac{1}{1 + r}\right)^{t} E_{t}
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`

\end{equation}

Where:

- $E_{t}$: earnings individuals are expected to generate at period t  
- $r$: real interest rate as the discounting rate  
- $t$: period t. Period 0 represents time of intervention. Individuals are assumed to enter the labor market 9 years after treatment.

At a high level all three approaches focus on the same type of benefits: the increase in incomes over the lifetime of beneficiaries of deworming. This is likely an under-estimate of the benefits as it does not quantify the non-pecuniary effects of improved health.  The costs can be separated into direct costs of implementing and evaluating deworming programs, and indirect costs, such as additional costs to the education system as a result of increased child attendance, associated with the benefits of deworming.

The main differences in benefits across the three approaches have to do with how to predict the earnings profiles over a lifecycle, and how to account for differences in worm prevalence rates and length of treatment across settings. Approaches 1 and 2 use different earning profiles, and approach 3 combines both earning profiles and adjusts for possible differences in prevalence rates of worm infections and length of treatment.

The main differences in costs between scenarios have to do with a) whether indirect costs are included, and b) how to compute the relevant unit cost for the analysis. The first two approaches include indirect costs and use the unit costs of a specific country (Kenya) where the study was originally conducted, while the third approach does not include indirect costs and use unit costs of various countries from data provided by Evidence Action.


### The discounting rate  {-}

All three approaches use the real interest rate ($r$) as the discounting rate. This is obtained from the interest rate on government bonds ($i$) minus the inflation rate ($\pi$).

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} - 1 \\
r \approx i - \pi
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`

\end{equation}

Where:   

- $r$: real interest rate as the discounting rate  
- $i$: interest rate on government bonds  
- $\pi$: inflation rate

The actual value varies across approaches depending on the time and country chosen. For example approach 1 uses the return from government bonds and the inflation rate in Kenya for the year 2016, while approaches 2 and 3 uses the values for the same country for the year 2019. This results in discount rates of `r paste(round(100 * interest_in,2), "%", sep="")` and `r paste(round(100 * interest_new_in,2), "%", sep="")` for approach 1 and, 2 and 3 respectively.

## Approach 1: @baird2016worms

In this first approach, the effect on earnings over the entire lifecycle is predicted by extrapolating the effects on hours worked by individuals in the original treatment group, ten years after the intervention.

Two types of results are presented: the total effect on earnings projected over a lifetime and the estimated fiscal effect due to the government collecting additional taxes on higher earnings. The effects are calculated in two scenarios: with and without externalities over the population of children who did not receive deworming interventions. In the original deworming study conducted in Kenya, there is evidence of epidemiological externalities for children who remained untreated but who attended treatment schools, as well as for children living near treatment schools. Externality effects may not be as relevant for current-day deworming programs since most programs are national programs that target all school-aged children (and in some cases, preschool-aged children) in at-risk areas.


###  Gains in earnings

Gains in earnings ($\Delta W_{t}$) are the result of multiplying expected earnings in a certain period ($w_t$) with the effects of deworming on worked hours. This effect can have two components: a direct effect of deworming on the individual ($\lambda_1$) and the indirect effect on earnings due to externalities ($\lambda_2$). The indirect effects are considered within the context of the treatment coverage and saturation.

<details><summary>Show all the details</summary>

\begin{equation}
\Delta W_{t} = w_{t}\left( \lambda_{1} + \frac{p \lambda_{2}}{R} \right)
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}

Where[^6]:   

 - $w_t$: the earnings in period $t$   
 - $\lambda_{1}$: the direct effects of deworming on earnings  
 - $\lambda_{2}$: the indirect effects of deworming on earnings   
 - $p$: saturation, measures the fraction of the population that is effectively using the treatment  
 - $R$: coverage, defined as the fraction, among all neighboring schools (within 6 km), that belongs to the treatment group  

[^6]: The original equation separates effects by gender. But the final calculation (behind table 5 in paper) does not separate by gender.

#### Earnings over time

Wages in year $t$ correspond to the initial weekly wage ($w_0$) adjusted by an economy-wide increase in salaries and by an increase in salaries due to additional experience at the individual level. The economy-wide wage adjustment is assumed to be equal to the per capita GDP growth ($g$) applied to the total number of years of work ($Xp$). The life cycle path for wages increases at decreasing rates (wages typically increase with more years of work, then decline later in a life cycle). It is assumed that individuals enter the labor force 10 years after the treatment period. Weekly wages are multiplied by 52 weeks to obtain the annual rate.

The initial wage in dollars ($w_{0}$) is a weighted average of wages for the control group in agriculture, working wage, and self-employed sectors ($ag, ww, se$). The weights correspond to the fraction of all the average worked hours dedicated to each sector ($h$).  

<!--To do: find the specific reference from in Suri (page, and table #,  location), and add using the @notation (you will need to edit the bibliography.bib file). If you cannot find the Suri reference, send me an email and I will look for it-->

The wage in agriculture comes from @suri2011selection, whereas the working wage comes from the study data and is defined as an hourly wage for those who reported more than 10 hrs of work per week in the control group. The self-employed wage ($w_{se}$) was constructed as the reported monthly earnings from self-employed profits, divided by the reported weekly number of hours worked in self-employment for those who worked a positive number of hours (multiplied by 4.5 to obtain the monthly total).

The monthly self-employed profits and self-employed hours for the control group, for those with positive hours, also comes from study data (Page 1168, Table 4, Panel C, Column 5, Row 1). The measure of hours in self employment used to compute wages is different from the one used to compute the weights above. The first one captures hours of work among those actively employed in the self-employed sector, and the second captures the average hours of work as self-employed among all the population of working age in the sample (hence capturing the relative importance of the self employed sector in the economy).


<details><summary>Show all the details</summary>

The wages/earnings are determined by:  

\begin{equation}
w_t =  \text{#weeks} \times w_0 (1 + g)^{Xp}(1 + \hat{\beta_1} Xp + \hat{\beta_2} Xp^2) \quad \text{for } t=10, \dots, 50
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w_0 = \frac{1}{ex} \sum_{l \in \{ag, ww, se\}}w_{l}\alpha_{l}
\\ \quad \text{with: } \alpha_{l}= \frac{ h_{l}}{h_{ag} + h_{ww} + h_{se}}
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

#### Deworming effects: direct and externalities

The estimated impact of deworming on hours worked comes from @baird2016worms and are estimated separately for men ($\lambda_{1,male}$) and women ($\lambda_{1,female}$). These two parameters are combined with a simple mean in the analysis.

The estimated externality effect ($\lambda_{2}$) reflects the additional hours worked due to individuals who did not receive the treatment but still saw reductions in the likelihood of infection due to lower worm prevalence in their community.  Note that this parameter is not estimated by gender, so we repeat its value two times. All the components to the equation \\ref{eq:`r equationIndex + 1`} come from @baird2016worms. The externalities effects are adjusted by the coverage and saturation of the original study.

#### Coverage and saturation of the original study

The coverage ($R$) is defined as the fraction, among all neighboring schools (within 6 km), that were treated within the study. Since the treatment was applied to approximately two thirds of the population, $R$ is set to: $R  = `r round(coverage_so, 2)`$[^6].  

The saturation of the intervention, $p$, measures the fraction of the population that is effectively using the treatment. It is defined as a weighted average of the treatment take-up under a full subsidy for deworming and the take-up under zero subsidy.   


[^6]: Last paragraph of page 9(1645) of @baird2016worms


For this setting @kremer2007illusion (Page 48, Table 1, Panel C, Col 1, Row 3) estimated that take-up with full subsidy ($Q(full)$) was `r q_full_so`. Miguel and Kremer (2004) (Table 3 and footnote 18) observed minimal to no take-up without subsidy ($Q(0)$), hence it is assigned the value of `r q_zero_so`.

### Costs

The costs are a combination of direct costs of mass deworming (relative to the status quo, which is no subsidy for deworming) and indirect costs on the education system due to the additional time treated individuals spend in school.

#### Direct costs: increase in deworming costs

Direct deworming costs ($DC$) are defined as the take-up under a mass deworming intervention ($Q_{2}$), times the per-capita costs of deworming under the intervention ($S_{2}$). These costs are compared to a status quo scenario where the government does not provide any additional resources for deworming. This analysis assumes that there is no subsidy for deworming under the status quo.    

##### Complete subsidy to per capita costs of deworming

With complete subsidy, the relevant costs represent the total direct costs of deworming in USD. The take-up with full subsidy ($Q_2$) comes from a previous study [@kremer2007illusion] and takes the value of `r q_full_so`.

#### Indirect costs: additional years of education and its costs for government

As a result of deworming treatment, there is an estimated increase in school attendance, which is multiplied by the cost of education per student to calculate the additional indirect cost on the education system imposed by a treated individual. The additional costs on education are computed as follows: first compute a cost per student ($K$). This is calculated as the salary of the teacher plus benefits, divided by the average number of students per teacher. Second, the cost per student is multiplied by the estimated increase in school attendance ($\Delta \overline{E}_{t}(S1,S2)$). For this we use a series of estimated effects, including the additional direct increase in secondary schooling from 1999 to 2007 obtained from an additional analysis related to @baird2016worms. This series does not take into account the externality effects. To incorporate externality effects, we would need another series (from the same source) that estimates the additional secondary schooling increase due to the externality in order to add it to the original series.

#### Assessing computational reproducibility of original results  

Without externalities, the original analysis (@baird2016worms) obtains a present value of costs of `r df_research_so$param[5] + df_research_so$param[6]` (table `r df_research_so$tablenum[5]`, column `r df_research_so$table_col[5]`, and adding rows `r paste0(df_research_so$table_row[5], " and ", df_research_so$table_row[6])`). Including externalities, they obtain a present value of benefits of  `r df_research_so$param[5] + df_research_so$param[6] + df_research_so$param[7]` (table `r df_research_so$tablenum[5]`, column `r df_research_so$table_col[5]`, and adding rows `r paste0(df_research_so$table_row[5], " and ", df_research_so$table_row[6]," and ", df_research_so$table_row[7])`).

## Approach 2: @klps4

In this second approach, benefits follow the same principle as in approach 1 (increase in lifetime earnings), but it uses updated data on the effects on the labor market outcomes. Instead of projecting a trend of earnings into the future (after the estimated impact of the 10 year follow-up), this analysis uses additional data from 15 and 20 year follow-ups after the original intervention.  Costs are fairly similar to approach 1, with the addition that in this second approach, the costs also account for discounting of the several rounds of treatment required for effective deworming.  Additionally, the interest rate is updated to current values of return on (Kenyan) government bonds and inflation.


### Gains in earnings

Gains in earnings ($\Delta W_{t}$) from 10, 15, and 20 years after the intervention are used to measure the effect of multiple rounds of deworming on welfare over time. This is an important difference from approach 1, which only measures gains in earnings at year 10 and extrapolates them into the future. To extrapolate earnings after the 20-year measurement, the authors assume that the welfare gains disapear 25 years after the intervention. Hence the treatment effect over an individual's working life is the sum of the treatment effects over their working lifetime[^8]. This approach also disregards externality effects and measures the estimated effects directly on earnings (as opposed to approach 1 that measures effects on earnings indirectly through hours worked). The estimated treatment effects that pools years 10, 15, and 20, is `r paste0("$", round(mean(lambda1_new_so),0) )` dollars per person per year.

Gains in yearly earnings represent the treatment effect on welfare ($\alpha^{pooled}$), which implicitly takes into consideration the life cycle profile of wages, economywide growth, etc.

[^8]: In another specification the authors assume that effects persist through the rest of an individual's working life. Here we select the specification that is most highlighted in the paper (most conservative specification). The authors also analyse the welfare effects over consumption, but given that they do not aggregate both outcomes in the welfare effect we only choose one and focus on earning for comparability with the approach 1).

### Costs

#### Direct costs: increase in deworming costs

Similar to approach 1, the direct deworming costs under approach 2 are calculated by comparing the costs under a complete subsidy to the costs under the status quo of no subsidy. The two main differences with the previous cost estimates are 1) now the direct costs are summed and discounted over the treatment period, and 2) cost data has been updated after gathering more recent figures from Evidence Action.


<details><summary>Show all the details</summary>

\begin{equation}
DC = \sum_{t=0}^{`r round(years_of_treat_0_so,1)-1`} \left( \frac{1}{1 + r}\right)^{t} \big[S_{2}Q(S_{2}) - S_{1}Q(S_{1}) \big]
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}


Since the analysis is discrete, and we cannot sum over a non-integer, we find

\begin{equation}
DC = \big[S_{2}Q(S_{2}) - S_{1}Q(S_{1}) \big] + \left( \frac{1}{1 + r}\right)\big[S_{2}Q(S_{2}) - S_{1}Q(S_{1}) \big] + \\

`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}

Where:

- $DC$: direct deworming costs   
- $r$: discounting rate, defined as the real interest rate  
- $S_2$: per-capita costs of deworming under the deworming intervention  
- $S_1$: per-capita costs of deworming if the government does not provide any additional resources for deworming  
- $Q(S_2)$: take-up under a mass deworming intervention  
- $Q(S_1)$: take-up without additional resources from the government

With complete subsidy, the costs of the intervention become the total direct costs of deworming each child (in USD). Most recent (2018) data from Evidence Action reveals this cost to be \$`r unit_cost_so` per year. Adjusting for purchasing power and inflation, we get a per capita cost of \$`r round(unit_cost_2017usdppp_so,2)`. Adding all indirect cost over an average `r round(years_of_treat_0_so,1)` years of treatment, the average cost of deworming each child over the entire treatment period is $`r format(round(s2_in * q2_in,2), nsmall = 2)`.


#### Indirect costs: additional years of education and its costs for government  

The indirect cost on the education system is calculated similarly to approach 1: the cost per student is multiplied by the increase in school attendance due to deworming. The cost of additional schooling is given by the product of the annual cost of schooling each child and the number of additional years children attend school as a result of deworming. This analysis assumes that pressure is added to educational institutions for a maximum of nine years, starting at year zero. The cost per student ($K$) is updated with new information on annual teacher salary (including benefits)[^9], $`r format(round(teach_sal_2017usdppp_so,0), scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` (also adjusted for PPP), and the same average number of students per teacher (`r n_students_so`).

Hence, the cost of schooling each child for an additional year is now $`r round(teach_sal_2017usdppp_so/n_students_so, 1)` (USD).

[^9]: Based on the upper tier of monthly teacher salaries reported by two Kenyan news sources: @nyanchama2018 and @oduor2017. Since compensation for teachers in rural villages where the treatment was administered is below the national average, we are overestimating the costs for a conservative analysis. The average number of students per teacher is `r n_students_so`.

Over this nine year period, treated students attended school for an additional `r round(sum(delta_ed_so[,1]),2)` years on average. Then we get an average cost of additional schooling per child over the nine-year period, $`r format(round((cost_per_student_in_new*sum( (1/(1+interest_new_in))^(0:8) * delta_ed_in )),2), nsmall = 2)`.


### Assessing computational reproducibility of original results  

The second approach does not report benefits and costs separatedly. With all these elements the main result from the original analysis that is comparable with the results discussed here is a NPV of `r df_research_so$param[9]` (table `r df_research_so$tablenum[9]`, column `r df_research_so$table_col[9]`, and row `r df_research_so$table_row[9]`) This result corresponds to a social internal rate of return of `r paste0(df_research_so$param[8], "%")` located as an inline result in the paper - also in `r df_research_so$figure_num[8]` - and in the appendix at table `r df_research_so$tablenum[8]`, column `r df_research_so$table_col[8]`, and row `r df_research_so$table_row[8]`). Following the steps described in this section, this analysis obtains the same result (`r a2_all_pe` and `r paste0(irr_in * 100, "%")` respectively without rounding).


```{r sum-tables20, purl=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=show_summary_tables}

table_1[9,2] <- paste0("$r_{16}=", interest_in, "$")

table_1 <- rbind(table_1, c("", paste0("$r_{19}=", interest_new_in, "$"), ""))

## Approach 3: Combination of Previous Approaches and Input From Key Policy Partners

In this third and final approach, we borrowed some methodological elements from @baird2016worms and @klps4 and sought feedback from a key policy partner to best identify one clear output to inform policy makers. We worked in collaboration with the NGO Evidence Action, a key technical assistance partner in this area. Evidence Action provided insights on what are the most relevant costs and benefits from the perspectives of policy makers, and on certain aspects of the analysis that could be updated with present-day data.

Under this approach, the benefits from deworming described in Approaches 1 and 2 are scaled to reflect differences in prevalence rates, and length of treatment. Additionally, the relevant costs are constrained to direct costs alone (excluding additional costs on education). Finally this approach uses inputs costs and prevalence that reflect the current settings where Evidence Action is currently supporting deworming interventions. As of 2020, Evidence Action supports deworming interventions in four countries.

### Benefits   


#### Adjusting for different prevalence rates  

To account for different prevalence rates ($\eta$), the estimated treatment effect is decomposed in the impact of deworming on children who were treated and had a worm infection, or the effective treatment effect of deworming ($\lambda_{1}^{eff}$), and children who were treated and did not have a worm infection. By construction, the effect on this last group should be zero. Hence the effective treatment of deworming on infected populations will be equal to the estimated treatment (on the ovearll population), divided by the proportion of the prevalence of infections.

In the original evaluation, the prevalence rates were very high (`r prevalence_0_so`), hence the effect on the infected population was similar to that of the overall population. Currently deworming interventions are often implemented in geographies with much lower prevalence rates (though in populations with sufficient infection to justify treatment in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines), hence to obtain the expected effect over the new region, we need to multiply the effect on the infected population by the prevalence rate in the new region ($\eta_{r}$).


<details><summary>Show all the details</summary>

For approach 3, we will modify treatment effects of approaches 1 and 2 (equation 4 and 13 respectively) by the following:   

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{1} = \eta \lambda^{eff}_{1} + (1 -  \eta) \times 0 \\
\lambda^{r}_{1} = \eta_{r}\lambda^{eff}_{1}
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\end{equation}

Where:

- $\lambda_1$: direct effects of deworming on individuals' earnings. Here we use the symbol for treatment effect of approach 1, but the same logic applies to the treatment effect of approach 2 ($\alpha^{pooled}$)
- $\lambda^{eff}_1$: impact of deworming on children who were treated and had a worm infection in the original evaluation  
- $\lambda^r_1$: impact of deworming on children who were treated and had a worm infection in the new region  
- $\eta$: prevalence rates in the original evaluation   
- $\eta_r$: prevalence rates in the new region

Evidence Action provided prevalence survey data for the geographies where they are involved. In order to be most analogous with the baseline prevalence estimate used in the original study, the prevalence estimates used are 1) the earliest point estimates available from before, or close to the time of, Evidence Action's involvement in that geography, and 2) are representative of any STH infection.      

#### Adjusting for different length of treatment  

The number of consecutive years over which a population is exposed to deworming treatment determines the intensity of the effects over this population over time. The two approaches reproduced so far hold the length of treatment constant at the levels estimated by the original study (`r round(years_of_treat_0_so, 1)` years). In this third approach we allow for the years of treatment to vary affecting both benefits and costs. We assume that the effects are linear in the number of years of treatment, with no additional effects after 6 years of treatment. We assumed a maximum of 6 years of impact in this case based on the 20 year KLPS follow-up research, which shows a levelling-off of treatment effect after approximately 6 years of deworming (@klps4; Figure A.5 in Appendix, page A-6).

Adding the element of treatment duration allows us to take into account differences in the number of years of deworming treatment across different country contexts depending on program dynamics. Although the counterfactual of worm prevalence in the absence of treatment is largely unknown, we know that consistent deworming continues to decrease worm prevalence over time, contributing to controlled worm environments and sustained benefits. In many deworming programs today, children receive regular treatment throughout a portion (and in some cases for the full term) of their primary schooling. It is worth noting that the assumption of linearity is an imperfect measure for various epidemiological reasons, though we include this variable of time into the equation as an estimate of our best guess at the differences in achieved impact over time, and in part because it helps capture that a new cohort enters primary school--and is therefore eligible for treatment--with each successive year of a deworming program.

<!--
Now the benefits are flexible to worm prevalence and lenght of treatment. To facilitate comparison with the other two approaches, we present here the results using the same prevalence and length of treatment assumptions parameters as in approach 1 and 2. Both approaches implicitly assume prevalence rates of 100% and do not distinguish between original population and target populuation. Both approaches also set the length of treatment at `r years_of_treat_0_so` years.
-->

To compute the benefits for this approach, we use data on prevalence and length of treatment for the four countries that Evidence Action has records for. Readers interested in assessing the effects of deworming for a specific value of prevalence and length of treatment are referred to the [interactive app](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/) (tab on key assumptions) where they can input the values that best reflect their setting. To facilitate comparison with the other two approaches, we present here the results using the same length of treatment assumptions parameters as in approach 1 and 2.  

Under approach 3, and using the same assumptions as above, the benefits will be: `r round(app3_pv_benef_no_ext_in, 2)` and `r round(app3_pv_benef_yes_ext_in, 2)` when using benefits of approach 1 without and with externalities, and `r round(app3_pv_benef_all_new_in, 2)` when using the benefit structure of approach 2.  

### Costs

Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative provides technical assistance to governments to implement school-based deworming programs. Deworm the World works closely with policymakers and government staff who are responsible for ensuring the implementation of deworming programs within their geographies to plan, scale, and sustain school-based deworming programs targeting at-risk children. Deworm the World works to gain and maintain critical support amongst these key stakeholders, thus having important influence over how policymakers take-in and use evidence for decision making. Through Evidence Action's technical assistance, which typically includes financial support for program implementation, they have access to country-level government cost data on what it takes to implement and evaluate school-based deworming programs across different contexts. To estimate the costs in this analysis, we use costs of deworming provided by Evidence Action (detailed below) and follow a similar approach to @givewell, which takes those costs and includes an additional estimate around the amount of government staff time required to run deworming programs. The default cost is the per unit cost per treatment round per child across all countries. This is obtained as the weighted average of per unit costs ($c_{i}$) in all countries where Evidence Action currently has data on implementation of deworming interventions [^10].

[^10]: In some settings Evidence Action provides two rounds of treatment per year. In those cases, the unit costs discussed here represent the sum of both rounds **[CONFIRM WITH GRACE]**

Costs per country include Evidence Action's technical assistance costs, government expenditure (including estimates of government staff time), and any other partner costs such as the cost of drugs donated by WHO. These items include: drug procurement and management, monitoring and evaluation, policy and advocacy, prevalence surveys, program management, public mobilization/community sensitization, and training and distribution. Costs can vary by geography due to factors of population size, treatment strategies, age of the program, and costs of "doing business."

The country weights are computed as the fraction of all treated individuals that correspond to a given country. The per capita cost of each country is obtained by dividing the country's total costs by the total number of treated individuals in a given period. Total costs for a country represent the total cost across country regions faced by three different payers: Evidence Action, country governments, and other partners.

The unit costs of treatments, although small, vary substantially across regions. When including cost information for all the countries where Evidence action has data (India, Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam) the unit costs is `r paste0("$", round(costs1_p2_in, 2))` per round of treatment [CONFIRM WITH GRACE, HARMONIZE WITH FOOTNOTE]. This final cost is primarily driven by the cost, and large population, of India, with a unit cost of `r paste0("$", round(costs1_p2_f(select_var = list("india")), 2 ))`, the other 3 remaining countries have relatively larger unit costs: `r paste0("$", round(costs1_p2_f(select_var = list("kenya")), 2 ))`, `r paste0("$", round(costs1_p2_f(select_var = list("nigeria")), 2 ))`, `r paste0("$", round(costs1_p2_f(select_var = list("vietnam")), 2 ))` for Kenya, Nigeria and Vietnam respectively.

## Accounting for Uncertainty

This open policy analysis has aimed to make all the analysis presented so far highly reproducible. One direct result of this novel approach is that now it is possible to thoroughly assess how the final policy estimates change when any of the underlying sources of the analysis changes. In this OPA we have identified each source used in the analysis behind benefits and costs of Deworming interventions. Each of these sources in turn is measured with some uncertainty (either in prediction of future values or estimation of past ones). Traditional policy analysis assumes that each of these sources has no uncertainty, and in some cases incorporates uncertainty or performed sensitivity analysis for a few parameters of interest. By following the open policy analysis principles we now can allow for each source to vary and explore the overall uncertainty of the final policy estimate.

Our approach consists in assuming that each source used in the analysis can be represented as a random draw from a normal distribution. The mean corresponds to the measured value. The standard deviation corresponds to the estimated standard error when available, and to a fraction of the mean when not available. As a default analysis we suggest to set it these standard deviations to 10% of the mean. This choice is arbitrary, but unlike the default arbitrary choice of setting the standard deviations to zero, it makes explicit the uncertainty and it can be modified in the app.

Let $x$ denote each source used in this analysis.  

\begin{equation}
x \sim N(\hat{x}, \sigma_{x})
`r equationIndex <- equationIndex + 1`
\label{eq:`r equationIndex`}
\tag{`r equationIndex`}
\\
\sigma_{x} =
\begin{cases}
\hat{\sigma_{x}} \quad \text{If $\sigma_{x}$ is available}\\
\\
\delta_{u}\hat{x} \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

As a default $\delta_{u} = 0.1$

# Main Results  

In this document we have presented three different approaches to measuring the welfare effects of deworming  interventions. The first approach was based on the original paper that measured the welfare effects of deworming (@baird2016worms) and proposed four different ways to compute this effect (with and without externalities, and from a societal or fiscal perspective). The second approach, based on more recent data, focused only on direct effects, and relies less on predictive effects over the lifecycle. Results for the second approach are also separated between the societal and fiscal perspective.

The third and final approach uses similar methodologies with three main differences. First, we allow the benefits to be scaled to account for differences in the prevalence of worm infections in other settings. Second, we allow the benefits to be scaled by the length of treatment provided to children within a particular setting. Finally, based on feedback from Evidence Action on the relevant costs from present-day deworming programs, this approach uses more up to date information on treatment costs and it does not take into account the knock-on effects of additional schooling costs as a result of increased school attendance, which are accounted for in approaches #1 and #2[^11].

[^11]: Evidence Action suggests that the added costs on education will not be considered as costs from a policy makers perspective. Those costs corresponds to another intervention on itself (education) and incorporating its costs would also require to incorporate its benefits. [CONFIRM WITH GRACE]

The table below summarises the three different approaches and the different alternatives within each approach. The main policy estimate is defined as that of Evidence Action (approach 3) using the latest research (@klps4): approach 3.3 in the table (in bold).
