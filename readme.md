This repository, its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
three key components of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on the costs and
benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings. Together,
these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to
facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

The three things this case study includes are:

1 - [An interactive plot](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/),
which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given
set of assumptions. Materials can be found in:
[`code\shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic
document](https://rpubs.com/fhoces/547979), which details all data, code, and assumptions
included in the analysis. Materials can be found in:
[`code\dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/tree/master/code/05_final_opa.Rmd).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials
necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.

This case study complies with the highest levels of the [Open Policy
Analysis (OPA)
Guidelines](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/). We also
look to demonstrate tools, ideas, and practices through which OPA can be
implemented in practice. This exercise, and future case studies, in turn
will inform the Guidelines.

BITSS to develop a demonstration of an OPA in your organization, please
