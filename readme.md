This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
three key components of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on the costs and
benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings. Together,
these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to
facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/),
which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given
set of assumptions. Materials can be found in:
[`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials
necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.

BITSS to develop a demonstration of a OPA in your organization please
